# Hello!

I'm a software developer based in Los Angeles CA. 

I'm currently writting code for [Kadenze inc](http://kadenze.com) and teaching courses in the [CalArts](https://calarts.edu/) music technology program.

I spend most of my time building things, making [art](https://www.instagram.com/dexterwritescode/), and riding my bike.

I'm always interested in new projects, big and small. [Email](mailto:dexterjshepherd@gmail.com) me if you want to work together
